# Book Recommendation Engine

Analyzed the user ratings given to books in GoodBooks and developed a recommendation engine to recommend similar books.

# Business Problem and Importance

This analysis serves to create a recommendation system for books that allows for targeted marketing efforts
The business questions we have tried to answer are:
1) For readers - What are the books you have not read that you are likely to enjoy reading? 
2) For businesses - What books should you market (in store or online ads) and to whom?

Being an avid reader myself, I have faced this dilemma of what should I read next every time I turn to the last cover of the book in hand. It's quite a difficult question to answer and having recommendations could make life so much more easier. So, I took up this project to help other readers and in the run, I wanted to see how I could help businesses benefit from this too.

# Data

The data was obtained from Kaggle - a data set on Goodbooks with information and ratings on 10,000 books.

# Approach

1) Started with exploratory data analysis and descriptive analytics that included study of outliers, missing values and cleaning the data set.
2) Employed content based, item based collbrative and user based collabrative filtering techniques to get recommendations
3) We also tried various similarity metrics and studied the results in each case
4) Improved results by adopting clustering methods
